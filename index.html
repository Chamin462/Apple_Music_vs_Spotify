            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>By the end of this article, we're talking about one of my favorite things, music, specifically Apple Music versus Spotify. We're going to figure out which of the two is the better music streaming service because we're going to break things down by the interface, ease of use, features, discoverability, compatibility, and, last but not least, price. Still, by the end of this video, we'll see who gets the crown. I will also share with you which music streaming service I prefer between the two, but you know I'm on my ER by new tip here. You see, I'm an artist and sensitive about my music. If you follow the channel, you know I'm very passionate about my music, but with all that said, Apple Music and Spotify, the odds may be in your favor. Let's begin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Interface: Ease of Use</h2>
            <p><a href="https://spotich.com/apple-music-vs-spotify/">Apple Music has a clean</a> aesthetic. They understand what's appealing to the eye because they emphasize album art with tabs as your navigation at the bottom, so it's spotless and easy to follow. It is straightforward and intuitive. Your Listen Now tab at the bottom left gives you the music you feel you may like and things you've heard most recently. Next, you have the Browse tab, which lets you see music suggestions. Then, you have your Radio tab, which takes you to live stations hosted by either artists or Apple employees. Next, the Library tab lets you glance at the music you've downloaded. Finally, your Search tab enables you to jump into a particular music category or search for a specific song. You can also search for lyrics. I should have focused on this feature for the longest time, but it's worthwhile.</p>
            <p>Jumping over to Spotify, you still have tabs on the Home tab at the bottom. However, the cover art is more miniature and aesthetically pleasing. The different size thumbnails of music make it seem more cluttered. What I like about Spotify is the music suggestions; it suggests music I want to listen to because it understands my spirit and heart. When you reach the Search tab, you can discover music similar to Apple Music, broken down by category, or search at the top for an artist or song by its lyrics. Then, you have your Library, which breaks down your playlists on your phone.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the interface, I have to give it to Apple Music because of its lovely aesthetic and organized flow. While I like Spotify's suggestions, its interface sometimes needs to be more precise and organized.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Both apps offer a lot of features. For example, they both provide a social experience in that you can follow people and see what they're listening to or save one of their playlists. Apple Music has Apple Music Radio, with artists and Apple employees hosting stations, offering a more personalized experience. Spotify has podcasts integrated into its app, making it a one-stop-shop, whereas Apple Music's podcasts are in a separate app.</p>
            <p>Apple Music also has music videos, which Spotify doesn't have. While music videos aren't as popular as they used to be, they are still a nice feature. Apple Music offers higher quality audio, including spatial, lossless, and Dolby Atmos, all bundled into the price. Spotify has been rumored to drop a higher-res audio experience but has yet to do so. Both apps offer live sessions specific to their platforms: Apple Music Sessions and Spotify Sessions. Apple Music has Sing, a karaoke feature that allows you to turn down the vocals so you can sing along. Spotify has a similar feature but cannot turn down the vocals.</p>
            <p>Spotify offers a unique feature called Jam Session, where you can create a session with others and listen to music in person or remotely. Apple Music has SharePlay, but it only works on Apple devices running iOS 17. Spotify also allows you to share specific song parts, which Apple Music doesn't do. Spotify's collaborative playlist feature is essential, as I often create playlists for couples when shooting weddings. Apple Music doesn't offer this, making it less collaborative. Spotify's AI DJ is another feature I love; it feels like a personal DJ recommending new and old songs, mixing things up for me.</p>
            <p>In terms of features, Spotify wins for me. While I love high-quality audio, the features and complete package that Spotify offers make it my preferred choice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Discoverability</h2>
            <p>Spotify understands me when it comes to music suggestions. Apple Music has a glass ceiling regarding discoverability, often suggesting top artists rather than underground ones. It can feel robotic and computer-generated, while Spotify feels more personalized. Spotify's TikTok-like feed for discovering new artists and the Discover Weekly playlist are excellent features for finding new music. Apple Music struggles with this, often pushing music that I want to avoid hearing on me.</p>
            <p>The winner in this category is Spotify, hands down.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Compatibility</h2>
            <p>Both services work well with most smart speakers. Apple Music works on Alexa-based and Google Home-based devices, while Spotify works on HomePods and similar devices. You can make Spotify the default player on a HomePod and Apple Music on a Google speaker. However, Spotify is better at jumping from speaker to speaker because it's linked to your account. Apple Music can be inconsistent, picking up the last song played on a specific device rather than your account. This makes Spotify more apparent and more streamlined.</p>
            <p>For compatibility, Spotify wins.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Price</h2>
            <p>Spotify offers a free plan with ads, whereas Apple Music requires a paid subscription. Both offer trials, and the pricing for student, individual, and family plans is similar. However, Spotify caps the family plan at two accounts, whereas Apple Music does not. Spotify's free plan gives it an edge, making it the winner in this category.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The crown winner for me is Spotify. While I love both services, Spotify edges out Apple Music because of its superior discoverability, interface, features, and compatibility. Spotify is the better option if you value discovering new music and are less interested in audio quality. Both services allow offline playback with a paid subscription, replacing the need to purchase albums. While other services like Tidal and Pandora exist, Spotify and Apple Music are the heavy hitters.</p>
